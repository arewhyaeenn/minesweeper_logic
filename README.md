#### Playing minesweeper for forward chaining and disjunction resolution
##### Ryan McIntyre

To watch the player, simply download "minesweeper.py" and "MSFoL.py",
adjust the grid size and number of mines in the last few lines of
"minesweeper.py", then run "minesweepery.py".

Note that this was my first coding project after a degree in mathematics,
and it has several flaws. Namely, the display method simply printing
(with a "red triangle" character marking flags, which may not display in
some consoles) and the player will occasionally spend considerable time
attempting to extrapolate information from areas with no uncovered
information.

Hopefully I'll find the time to make a GUI and rewrite the player at some
point :)
